############ The greedy algorithm for exemplar clustering #########
# An implementation of the greedy algorithm that optimizes a function f()
# under a cardinality constraint k. Also contains an implementation of the
# examplar-based clustering function f() from

# The loss function for the k-medoid problem defined in Section 3.1

# Input:

# Output:
#   An integer corresponding to the loss from having S as exemplars
# Dependencies:
#   uses the distance function d(.,.) that is dependent on the application
