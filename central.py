########### A Central Machine ###############
# The central machine first receives solutions from the m local machines,
# then loads data D from filename, and then find the best subset of size at 
# most k of the union all the local solutions V that best represents data D.
# Input:
#   filename: a string that contains the data D that needs to represented
#   k: an integer that is the cardinality constraint for the solution
#   m: an integer that is the number of local machines that this central 
#      machines should receive local solutions from.
#   e0: an auxiliary element
# Output:
#   S: a list of elements that is a subset of all local solutions V that
#      represents the data D from filename
